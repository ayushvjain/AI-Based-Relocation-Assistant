# AI-Based Relocation Assistant

## Project Overview

The AI-Based Relocation Assistant is an intelligent platform designed to help users discover their ideal home based on their current living conditions and future preferences. By leveraging advanced recommendation algorithms and artificial intelligence, this system simplifies the home-search process by delivering personalized property recommendations.

## Description

Finding the perfect home can be overwhelming with traditional search methods. Our solution:

- **Analyzes your current living situation:** Gathers details such as your address, rent, and current property type.
- **Captures your future preferences:** Collects your desired location, safety, and budget priorities.
- **Generates personalized recommendations:** Uses an AI-powered recommendation engine that compares your data against an extensive property database to suggest the best matches for your next home.

This project is built with a **React.js** frontend and a **Flask** backend, seamlessly working together to provide a responsive and interactive user experience.
